# 03/05 Activity

In this activity, each student will give a short elevator pitch. Students should
prepare their slides using [GitPitch](https://gitpitch.com/). We will provide a
public repository for each student in our GitHub organization as we did in the
previous activity.

Each student will have about 6 min. for presentation and 1 min. for Q&A. The
goal of the presentation is to show (and brag) your technical skills. You can
show a portfolio of your past projects, or can describe the most successful
project that you have done so far. Note we are specifically interested in your
engineering skills, but not in your hacking skills. We want to team up the
students for the next activity, which is all about building large S/W
application(s). Therefore, we want to know what kind of engineering platforms,
such as Django, Flask, etc., that you have been working on, but we are not
instered to know whether you have exploited a browser or not.
