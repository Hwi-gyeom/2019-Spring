[CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) is a file that
contains a sequence of comma-separated values. One tricky part of CSV is that
each cell in CSV may contain quoted commas (with double
quotes). [RFC4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) formalizes the
specification of CSV. And your goal is to create a program that takes in a
well-formed CSV file and a number N as input, and prints out only the N-th
column of the CSV. Note N starts from 1, but not from 0.

The exit code of the program should be either 0 (success) or 1 (failure). In
particular, the program should terminate with exit code 1 if one of the
following conditions met:

1. If the given CSV is not well-formed.
1. If the given column number N is out of the valid range of the given CSV
   file. For example, when N is 0, it will exit with failure.

# Command-Line Interface

The program takes in two command line arguments: (1) the path to the CSV file, and
(2) the column number. For example, your program written in Python should run as below:
```
$ python myprog.py ./csvs/mycsv.csv 2
```

The above command line should print out the 2nd column of the given CSV file
(`mycsv.csv`) if the CSV file is well-formed, and has two or more columns.
