### Building Your Web of Trust

Create your PGP key, and get it signed by at least five people. Note, you should
not create dummy keys by yourself. When you are done, you should publish your
signed key to our GitHub repository ([the `/Keys` directory](/Keys)) by creating
a Pull Request (PR).

Note one of our course instructors will reach you out and ask you to sign their
key too. Signing course instructors' key(s) is also part of this
activity. Remember, we need to build a web of trust!

### Submission (by 23:59:59 3/18/2019)

Create a simple markdown document (README.md) in your personal repository: we
will give you an invitation link so that you can create your own repository
under KAIST-IS521 organization. The README file should contain the followings:

- An image showing your web of trust. You can use
  [sig2dot](http://www.chaosreigns.com/code/sig2dot/) for this purpose.

- A digitally signed copy of the [Ethical Conduct Agreement
  form](https://github.com/KAIST-IS521/Agreement). Use your PGP key and copy
  both the agreement form and the signature file to your own repository. You
  should follow the instruction there, i.e., you need to modify the agreement
  accordingly.

**We will award extra points to a student who built the biggest web of trust.**
